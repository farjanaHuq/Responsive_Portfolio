                        The first camera I bought when I was a sophomore, that was a Sony point shoot camera. I mostly
                        used
                        to take photos of my friends, kids and nature at that time in Bangladesh. The first DSLR camera
                        was
                        my Canon 500D 18-55mm f 3.5-5.6 lens, which was a gift from my mom as a first anniversary gift
                        on
                        2011.
                        But I slowly started learning about photography right after my first child was born on 2014.
                        Currently
                        I am playing with Canon 6D, 50 mm f 1.4 lens, and I love it.</p>
                    <p>
                        The book that I admired most about photography is “How to photograph almost everything” by Tom
                        Ang.
                        This is a very good book where almost everything about photography is described very precisely
                        and
                        clearly. However, I love the work of Steve McCurry, and Art Wolfe. I take Dave’s class on
                        photography,
                        it’s a room full of a wonderful teacher, and so many beautiful people! Currently I am a stay at
                        home mom,
                        so I took the photography class to give myself a room to keep something that I love. Dave’s
                        class
                        has just opened my door.

                        I find the most alluring thing about photography is the art of capturing a simple object
                        extraordinarily. To me the most challenging part about photography is finding the correct light
                        and
                        perspective in a photo. The other challenge I feel when I take photos of kids, since they
                        aren’t
                        always willing to take photos. But I always like to capture them as they are. I love all their
                        actions. I
                        love to take photos of kids.
